# MiniJava to LLVM-IR Compiler

This project implements a compiler for the MiniJava language in Java.
It performs lexical analysis, parsing, semantic checks, and generates
LLVM intermediate representation files that can be compiled with tools
like Clang to produce executable binaries.

This was a semester project for the University of Athens Compilers course.

### Compilation:
- Run `make` for compiling all files
- Run `make clean` for cleaning all generated files

### Execution: 
- Run `java Main <file1> <file2>... ` to run for multiple files

### Features:
- The program the input files for semantic errors.
If an error is found, an exception is raised, and it appears in the terminal the line that was 
problematic, followed by the error. If no errors are found,
the program prints the offsets for all the variables and methods for each class.
- We keep a map that includes all the classes(and their information). We pass this map to all visitors. At the end, we
use it to set the offsets of all classes,methods,variables and print them.
- We use a virtual table object to map Methods with their names. When a class has a super class, it stores the superclass methods first, then its own.

### Visitors:
In this exercise we were asked to use the Visitor Pattern.
We use 4 visitors in this implementation:
- ClassNameVisitor: Find and stores all classes' declarations and arguments, existing in the file.
- MethodNameVisitor: Find and stores all class variables, methods' declarations and methods' arguments, existing in the file.
- MethodsBody: the variables and statements of the methods and the type checking, using all the stored information at this point.
- IRGenerator: It generates the llvm-ir file
